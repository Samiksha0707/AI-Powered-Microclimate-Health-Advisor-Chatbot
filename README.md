"Self-initiated project to provide personalized health insight using AI and ML ."

## Data Source & Disclaimer

This dataset is created for academic and project demonstration purposes.
Environmental values such as temperature, humidity, and AQI are
estimated and structured to simulate realistic climate-health
conditions across selected Indian cities.
The data does not represent real-time official meteorological
records and should be used only for learning, analysis practice,
and model development within this project.

## Project Purpose

The objective of this project is to explore the relationship between
micro-climate conditions and common health concerns using structured
data and AI-based analysis.
This work is intended for educational learning, data analysis practice,
and experimentation with AI/ML techniques in health-climate insights.
